# Reasons for Learning

1. Enrich

## Engage
Answer "Why should I learn X?"

Eg. You should learn Set theory because that is the way
modern databases work. It is used by businesses and
industries to answer questions like:

    "What proportion of this bank's customers spent more
    than $1000 last month and did not fully pay up their
    bill?"

This could be implemented with a chatbot. See:
[Q and A maker](https://qnamaker.ai) . You will need
a Microsoft account.

The response text could be put through text-to-speech.
Bluemix Watson as well as Microsoft offer such services.


## Enrich
Provide a lesson which caters for auditory, visual and
kinesthetic learners.

Eg. Use the TI cc2650 IOT multi-sensor to demonstrate usage
of the small angle formula: angle in radians * baseline length.

We will need to track the student, hence some form of
login / authentication will be required.
